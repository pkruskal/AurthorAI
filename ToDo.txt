gotten up to line 26 in train.py but failed to fully load in the data

Work in scrape authors for saving and loading processed texts
  need to build unpickling scripts in scrapeAuthors after text has been parsed
  need to build a function to check if text has already been parsed to keep from re-runing it

make a seperate function for parsing text and identifying sentences, words, and POS
  the current on is really really slow!!
  perhaps add identificaiton of chapters/paragraphs/etc. (could speed things up?)
  save this data and make it checkable and loadable since it is a huge time sink
  rewrite def vocabularize to take advantage of this
